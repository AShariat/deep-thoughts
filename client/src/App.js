// ApolloProvider is a special type of React component that we'll use to provide data to all of the other components. ApolloClient is a constructor function that will help initialize the connection to the GraphQL API server. InMemoryCache enables the Apollo Client instance to cache API response data so that we can perform requests more efficiently. createHttpLink allows us to control how the Apollo Client makes a request. Think of it like middleware for the outbound network requests.
import {
  ApolloProvider,
  ApolloClient,
  InMemoryCache,
  createHttpLink,
} from "@apollo/client";
// BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route are components that the React Router library provides. We renamed BrowserRouter to Router to make it easier to work with.
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

import Header from "./components/Header";
import Footer from "./components/Footer";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import Login from "./pages/Login";
import NoMatch from "./pages/NoMatch";
import SingleThought from "./pages/SingleThought";
import Profile from "./pages/Profile";
import Signup from "./pages/Signup";

// With the preceding code, we first establish a new link to the GraphQL server at its /graphql endpoint with createHttpLink(). After we create the link, we use the ApolloClient() constructor to instantiate the Apollo Client instance and create the connection to the API endpoint. We also instantiate a new cache object using new InMemoryCache(). We could customize this to the application, but by default, it works well for this purpose.
const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: "/graphql",
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: httpLink,
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

// Note how we wrap the entire returning JSX code with <ApolloProvider>. Because we're passing the client variable in as the value for the client prop in the provider, everything between the JSX tags will eventually have access to the server's API data through the client we set up.
// We've wrapped the <div className="flex-column"> element in a Router component, which makes all of the child components on the page aware of the client-side routing that can take place now.
// In the <div className="container"> element, we place a singular Routes component that will hold several Route components that signify this part of the app as the place where content will change according to the URL route. When the route is /, the Home component will render here. When the route is /login, the Login component will render.
